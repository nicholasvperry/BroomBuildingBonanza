Have you ever been sitting there wishing you had a magic broom? Broom Building Bonanza does just that. It is a fun app that allows users to custom build their own flying brooms! While building your broom you will see a custom 3D model of your broom, as well as the speed, acceleration, and weight of the broom. Customers are also able to send a custom letter along with their broom if it is being sent as a gift. Customers can see past purchases, including checking the status of a purchase, and updating the note if needed until the day the broom is ready to ship. As an employee you can view all open orders. Orders are sorted by order date so the oldest orders can be built first. Employees can take on open projects and update the status of the project as they build the broom, allowing the customers to see the progress as the broom is being built. This app was built with React and custom CSS styles. The app also uses JSON-server which is a mock API to track all orders, customer, and products available.

I have made a short demo where you can checkout the app [by clicking here!](https://www.loom.com/share/13c11485b2894fdeaa7bad841a6ed771)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://www.loom.com/share/13c11485b2894fdeaa7bad841a6ed771).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
